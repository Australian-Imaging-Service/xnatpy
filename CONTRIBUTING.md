# Contributing to XNATpy
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitLab
We use GitLab to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Please contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitLab's [issues](https://gitlab.com/radiology/infrastructure/xnatpy/-/issues)
We use GitLab issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Please at least mention the following:

- the version of XNAT you are using
- the version of XNATpy you are using
- the code used that led to the error
- in case of an exception, the stack-trace

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We would ask you to use the [PEP8 coding style ](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) 
which can be linted with [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)
