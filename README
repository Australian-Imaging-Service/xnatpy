======
XNATPY
======
A new XNAT client that exposes XNAT objects/functions as python
objects/functions.

Getting started
---------------

To install just use the setup.py normally::

  python setup.py install

To get started, create a connection and start querying::

  >>> import xnat
  >>> session = xnat.connect('https://central.xnat.org', user="", password="")
  >>> session.projects['Sample_DICOM'].subjects

when using IPython most functionality can be figured out by looking at the
available attributes/methods of the returned objects.

Status
------

Currently we do not support the creation of Projects, Subjects, Experiments, etc
via code. You can create resources and uploads files to them. Also it is
possible to import data via the import service (upload a zip file). There is
also some support for working with the prearchive (reading, moving, deleting and
archiving).

There is virtuall no documentation or testing, this is a known limitation.
